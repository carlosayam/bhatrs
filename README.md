# B hat estimator in Rust

(c) 2025, Carlos Aya-Moreno

Example implementation of the B hat estimator in Rust / Burn.

Using [Burn](https://burn.dev/) as it seems a promising alternative to Python's torch,
although this estimator is _not_ a traditional NN model.

Implements the estimator in paper.pdf, equations (3) and (4).

At the moment, it does not work.

1. Install Rust and Cargo

2. Run `cargo build` to compile

3. Run `cargo run` to run it
